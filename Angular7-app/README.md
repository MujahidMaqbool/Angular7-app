This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## Description
An angular app that meets the following requirements:
1) Demonstrates the usage of ngOnChanges, @Ouput() and @Input()
2) Lazy load modules
3) Demonstrates the usages of route guards
4) Passes data between pages.Have an input field in one page of which contents is displayed in the second page.
5) Has page transition animations. Here please make 2 examples, one with angular-animations and one that uses just css classes with animations for things like fading in an element.
6) Has one route that demonstrates how nested <router-outlet> works.
7) Have 2 inputs with some simple validation (like an email validation) without the require of angular-forms and ngModel
8) Demonstrates the usage of ng-content.
9) Have an input directive that restricts the input to numbers only and auto formats the input into currency, ex:$1,234. The field must    change its format as user types.
10) Demonstrates various ways to bind component properties to an associated template
